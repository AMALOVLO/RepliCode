# RepliCode
RepliCode is an attempt to create a python script that creates files infinitely without actually testing it. This could potentially be dangerous- as it uses a while loop should (Theoretically) open files. You have been warned.
The goal of this is to try and get practice for community engagement with my future projects. (or, in other words, learn which ways I should try to communicate with the residents of Github)

Terms of Usage:
Taking snippets is perfectly fine. Copy the entire code if you want and re-post it- on the condition that you include this README. Credit me if you want, I dont really care and the only reason im writing this is because i am slightly bored. No need to reach out to me for permission- use this as you will- with one exception: DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES.
